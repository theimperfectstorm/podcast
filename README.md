## On March 13th, 2020, everything changed.

Founded during the onset of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, these fellas get together every
few days just to wrap their heads around what's goin on. Sometimes there are guests.

### Beer Milkshake

we here at the imperfect storm are no different than you in that we're all - ALL OF US - looking for our metaphorical lost shaker of salt.

jimmy buffet is not one of my favorites, but the song impresses me, especially when he says, "some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but i know it's my own damned fault." rap on, jimmy. take personal responsibility for your karma.

i think we should excuse mr. buffet for writing such lyrics as "i stepped on a pop top; i blew out my flip flop." and who amongst us is not an inner parrot-head, overdosing on tequila and having bad-crazy thoughts, like what a beer milkshake would taste like.

mr. buffet has been to the mountain top, but i'm not sure what mountain he climbed.
